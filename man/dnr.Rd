\title{dnr: A package for simulating dynamic networks using ERGM family models.}
\description{
This package provides functions for fitting lagged exponential family models on dynamic network data, simulation from the models and model diagnostics. \cr

\details{This package was developed with help from ARO YIP award
  \#W911NF-14-1-0577. \cr
