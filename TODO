# Add edgecov(log(Nvertex)) as exvar for edge model
# Add exvar in paramVertex
# exvar should be able to take in functions that would evaluated in edgecov.
# like log(nVertex)
# Change interface for paramest and simulate_engine
# Implement a non smooth version of engineVertex and compare

## add comparison metrics to dnr
## referee pass through of manuscript
